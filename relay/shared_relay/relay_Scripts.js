// This is an example relay page how you can make your own relay without needing to script something up, maybe you want an interface of your own eh?
// This will load the json file 'test.json' inside the 'pages' folder. To use this relay script, just move it into the 'relay' folder
require("relay/shared_relay/shared_relay.js").main("test");
